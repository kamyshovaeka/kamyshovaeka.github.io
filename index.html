        <p>The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye is an ongoing comic series published by IDW Publishing, starting in January 2012. This series follows the adventures of Rodimus and his team as they travel through space, hunting for the legendary Knights of Cybertron (so they tell themselves) and having adventures along the way. But mostly it's about lonely nobodies hanging out pretending they have friends.</p>
